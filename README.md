Arduino based dispenser for oats

Hardware:
Arduino UNO
LCD Keypad shield
High torque DC motor, 12rpm, 12V, 4mm shaft (avoid the N20 motors, they are to weak)

Cereal dispenser (see picture in repo, search for e.g. PASTA CEREAL DISPENSER DRY FOOD STORAGE CONTAINER DISPENSE MACHINE)

3D-printed:
Shaft adapter

Assembly:

Remove the turning knob and shaft from the dispenser. Remove the slotted cog-wheel. Let the clear plastic container be in place, in the stand.

Put a very long 5mm drill through the hole of the shaft. Drill through the stand, this is the hole wher the motro will be mounted.

On the back side of the stand make th hole bigger, around 25mm, and make small wholes for the scrws in the next wall. These screws will fix the motor position during operation. Wait with mounting of teh motor.

Print the shaft adapter.

Put the cog-wheel back but with the shaft pointing towards the back. Wiggle the container in position, put the adapter on the cof-wheel shaft and put the motor shaft in the other end of the adapter. 

Use screws to fix the motor in position.
